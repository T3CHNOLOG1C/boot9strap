Boot9/Boot11 code execution via Boot9strap with the removal of the bootrom / OTP dumping button combination.

For more details about Boot9strap, refer to [this presentation](https://sciresm.github.io/33-and-a-half-c3/) by [SciresM](https://github.com/SciresM).

Install via [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller).

Launches "boot.firm" off of the SD card or CTRNAND, however, to keep it hidden with this patch, I recommend loading one of the "hidden" releases of [Sentry](https://github.com/Jan200101/)'s [fork of Luma3DS](https://github.com/Jan200101/Luma3DS) from CTRNAND.
